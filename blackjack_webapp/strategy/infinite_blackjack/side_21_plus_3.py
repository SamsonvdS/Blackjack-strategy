# 21+3 - side bet calculation

You win with this side bet if your first two cards and the dealer's open card are a specific combination (so the first three cards).

<b>Payouts of three card combinations:</b>
- Suited Trips pays 100 units (three identical cards (same type and same suit))
- Straight Flush pays 40 units (three cards in sequence (2-10, J, Q, K, A) all in the same suit)
- Three of a Kind pays 30 units (three cards of the same value but different suits)
- Straight pays 10 units (three cards in sequence (2-10, J, Q, K, A) with different suits)
- Flush pays 5 units (three non-sequential cards in the same suit)
